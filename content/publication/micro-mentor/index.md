abstract: While synchronous one-on-one help for software learning is rich and valuable,
  it can be difficult to find and connect with someone who can provide assistance.
  Through a formative user study, we explore the idea of fixed-duration, one-on-one
  help sessions and find that 3 minutes is often enough time for novice users to explain
  their problem and receive meaningful help from an expert. To facilitate this type
  of interaction, we developed MicroMentor, an on-demand help system that connects
  users via video chat for 3-minute help sessions. MicroMentor automatically attaches
  relevant supplementary materials and uses contextual information, such as command
  history and expertise, to encourage the most qualified users to accept incoming
  requests. These help sessions are recorded and archived, building a bank of knowledge
  that can further help a broader audience. Through a user study, we find MicroMentor
  to be useful and successful in connecting users for short teaching moments.
