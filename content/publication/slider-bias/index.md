abstract: Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) are input mechanisms which allow
  users to specify a value within a predefined range. At a minimum, sliders and VASs
  typically consist of a line with the extreme values labeled. Additional decorations
  such as labels and tick marks can be added to give information about the gradations
  along the scale and allow for more precise and repeatable selections. There is a
  rich history of research about the effect of labelling in discrete scales (i.e.,
  Likert scales), however the effect of decorations on continuous scales has not been
  rigorously explored. In this paper we perform a 2,000 user, 250,000 trial online
  experiment to study the effects of slider appearance, and find that decorations
  along the slider considerably bias the distribution of responses received. Using
  two separate experimental tasks, the trade-offs between bias, accuracy, and speed-of-use
  are explored and design recommendations for optimal slider implementations are proposed.
