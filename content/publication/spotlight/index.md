abstract: We describe a new interaction technique, called a spotlight, for directing
  the visual attention of an audience when viewing data or presentations on large
  wall-sized displays. A spotlight is simply a region of the display where the contents
  are displayed normally while the remainder of the display is somewhat darkened.
  In this paper we define the behavior of spotlights, show unique affordances of the
  technique, and discuss design characteristics. We also report on experiments that
  show the benefit of using the spotlight a large display and standard desktop configuration.
  Our results suggest that the spotlight is preferred over the standard cursor and
  outperforms it by a factor of 3.4 on a wall-sized display.
