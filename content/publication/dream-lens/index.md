abstract: This paper presents Dream Lens, an interactive visual analysis tool for
  exploring and visualizing large-scale generative design datasets. Unlike traditional
  computer aided design, where users create a single model, with generative design,
  users specify high-level goals and constraints, and the system automatically generates
  hundreds or thousands of candidates all meeting the design criteria. Once a large
  collection of design variations is created, the designer is left with the task of
  finding the design, or set of designs, which best meets their requirements. This
  is a complicated task which could require analyzing the structural characteristics
  and visual aesthetics of the designs. Two studies are conducted which demonstrate
  the usability and usefulness of the Dream Lens system, and a generatively designed
  dataset of 16,800 designs for a sample design problem is described and publicly
  released to encourage advancement in this area.
