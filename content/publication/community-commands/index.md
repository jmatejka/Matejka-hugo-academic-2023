abstract: We explore the use of modern recommender system technology to address the
  problem of learning software applications. Before describing our new command recommender
  system, we first define relevant design considerations. We then discuss a 3 month
  user study we conducted with professional users to evaluate our algorithms which
  generated customized recommendations for each user. Analysis shows that our item-based
  collaborative filtering algorithm generates 2.1 times as many good suggestions as
  existing techniques. In addition we present a prototype user interface to ambiently
  present command recommendations to users, which has received promising initial user
  feedback.
