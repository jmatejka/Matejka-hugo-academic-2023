abstract: 'Despite an abundance of carefully-crafted tutorials, trial-and-error remains
  many peopleâ€™s preferred way to learn complex software. Yet, approaches to facilitate
  trial-and-error (such as tooltips) have evolved very little since the 1980s. While
  existing mechanisms work well for simple software, they scale poorly to large feature-rich
  applications. In this paper, we explore new techniques to support trial-and-error
  in complex applications. We identify key benefits and challenges of trial-and-error,
  and introduce a framework with a conceptual model and design space. Using this framework,
  we developed three techniques: ToolTrack to keep track of trial-and-error progress;
  ToolTrip to go beyond trial-and-error of single commands by highlighting related
  commands that are frequently used together; and ToolTaste to quickly and safely
  try commands. We demonstrate how these techniques facilitate trial-and-error, as
  illustrated through a proof-of-concept implementation in the CAD software Fusion&nbsp;360.
  We conclude by discussing possible scenarios and outline directions for future research
  on trial-and-error.'
