abstract: Dementia is a progressive, degenerative syndrome that erodes cognition,
  long term memory, and the ability to maintain social relationships. Anxiety is common
  among those with dementia, and ranges from momentary and mild, to chronic and severe.
  Listening to familiar music from childhood or early adulthood has been shown to
  provide therapeutic and positive quality of life effects for individuals with dementia,
  but most modern interfaces are unfamiliar and difficult to use which may add frustration
  and stress that music is intended to relieve. To enable individuals with dementia
  to control playback of music, we present AMI, a tangible music player that can be
  reconfigured and adapted to meet the changing needs and preferences of individuals.
  AMI provides a set of input components (e.g., buttons, switches, knobs) with varying
  physical properties which can be easily interchanged by a non-technical user (such
  as a caregiver). This work contributes the system design, results of user tests
  with the target population, as well as a set of design principles that can be used
  in the development of future interfaces.
