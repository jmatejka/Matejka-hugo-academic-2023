abstract: In this paper we present Ambient Help, a system that supports opportunistic
  learning by providing automatic, context-sensitive learning resources while a user
  works. Multiple videos and textual help resources are presented ambiently on a secondary
  display. We define and examine a collection of design consideration for this type
  of interface. After describing our implementation details, we report on an experiment
  which shows that Ambient Help supports finding more helpful information, while not
  having a negative impact on the user's productivity, as compared to a traditional
  help condition.
