 abstract = {Citeology is an interactive visualization that looks at the relationships between research publications through their use of citations. The sample corpus uses all 3,502 papers published at ACM CHI and UIST between 1982 and 2010, and the 11,699 citations between them. A connection is drawn between each paper and all papers which it referenced from the collection. For an individual paper, the resulting visualization represents a "family tree" of sorts, showing multiple generations of referenced papers which the target paper built upon, and all descendant generations of future papers.},
