abstract: Citeology is an interactive visualization that looks at the relationships
  between research publications through their use of citations. The sample corpus
  uses all 3,502 papers published at ACM CHI and UIST between 1982 and 2010, and the
  11,699 citations between them. A connection is drawn between each paper and all
  papers which it referenced from the collection. For an individual paper, the resulting
  visualization represents a \"family tree\" of sorts, showing multiple generations
  of referenced papers which the target paper built upon, and all descendant generations
  of future papers.
