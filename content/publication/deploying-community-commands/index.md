abstract: In 2009 we presented the idea of using collaborative filtering within a
  complex software application to help users learn new and relevant commands (Matejka
  et al. 2009). This project continued to evolve and we explored the design space
  of a contextual software command recommender system and completed a four-week user
  study (Li et al. 2011). We then expanded the scope of our project by implementing
  CommunityCommands, a fully functional and deployable recommender system. CommunityCommands
  was made available as a publically available plug-in download for Autodesk's flagship
  software application AutoCAD. During a one-year period, the recommender system was
  used by more than 1100 AutoCAD users. In this paper, we present our system usage
  data and payoff. We also provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and design
  issues associated with developing and deploying the front end AutoCAD plug-in and
  its back end system. This includes a detailed description of the issues surrounding
  cold start and privacy. We also discuss how our practical system architecture was
  designed to leverage Autodesk's existing Customer Involvement Program (CIP) data
  to deliver in-product contextual recommendations to end-users. Our work sets important
  groundwork for the future development of recommender systems within the domain of
  end-user software learning assistance.
