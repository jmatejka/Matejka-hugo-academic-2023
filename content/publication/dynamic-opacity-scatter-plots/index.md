abstract: Scatterplots are an effective and commonly used technique to show the relationship
  between two variables. However, as the number of data points increases, the chart
  suffers from \"over-plotting\" which obscures data points and makes the underlying
  distribution of the data difficult to discern. Reducing the opacity of the data
  points is an effective way to address over-plotting, however, setting the individual
  point opacity is a manual task performed by the chart designer. We present a user-driven
  model of opacity scaling for scatter plots built from crowd-sourced responses to
  opacity scaling tasks using several synthetic data distributions, and then test
  our model on a collection of real-world data sets.
