abstract: We present Patina, an application independent system for collecting and
  visualizing software application usage data. Patina requires no instrumentation
  of the target application, all data is collected through standard window metrics
  and accessibility APIs. The primary visualization is a dynamic heatmap overlay which
  adapts to match the content, location, and shape of the user interface controls
  visible in the active application. We discuss a set of design guidelines for the
  Patina system, describe our implementation of the system, and report on an initial
  evaluation based on a short-term deployment of the system.
