abstract: When users complete tasks on the computer, the knowledge they leverage and
  their intent is often lost because it is tedious or challenging to capture. This
  makes it harder to understand why a colleague designed a component a certain way
  or to remember requirements for software you wrote a year ago. We introduce think-aloud
  computing, a novel application of the think-aloud protocol where computer users
  are encouraged to speak while working to capture rich knowledge with relatively
  low effort. Through a formative study we find people shared information about design
  intent, work processes, problems encountered, to-do items, and other useful information.
  We developed a prototype that supports think-aloud computing by prompting users
  to speak and contextualizing speech with labels and application context. Our evaluation
  shows more subtle design decisions and process explanations were captured in think-aloud
  than via traditional documentation. Participants reported that think-aloud required
  similar effort as traditional documentation.
