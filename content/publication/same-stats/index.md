abstract: Datasets which are identical over a number of statistical properties, yet
  produce dissimilar graphs, are frequently used to illustrate the importance of graphical
  representations when exploring data. This paper presents a novel method for generating
  such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches
  in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random
  perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome
  through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit
  of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant
  between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting
  output.
