abstract: Online streaming video systems have become extremely popular, yet navigating
  to target scenes of interest can be a challenge. While recent techniques have been
  introduced to enable real-time seeking, they break down for large videos, where
  scrubbing the timeline causes video frames to skip and flash too quickly to be comprehendible.
  We present Swifter, a new video scrubbing technique that displays a grid of pre-cached
  thumbnails during scrubbing actions. In a series of studies, we first investigate
  possible design variations of the Swifter technique, and the impact of those variations
  on its performance. Guided by these results we compare an implementation of Swifter
  to the previously published Swift technique, in addition to the approaches utilized
  by YouTube and Netfilx. Our results show that Swifter significantly outperforms
  each of these techniques in a scene locating task, by a factor of up to 48%.
