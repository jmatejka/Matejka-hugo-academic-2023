abstract: Despite the prominence of multi-touch technologies, there has been little
  work investigating its integration into the desktop environment. Bringing multi-touch
  into desktop computing would give users an additional input channel to leverage,
  enriching the current interaction paradigm dominated by a mouse and keyboard. We
  provide two main contributions in this domain. First, we describe the results from
  a study we performed, which systematically evaluates the various potential regions
  within the traditional desktop configuration that could become multi-touch enabled.
  The study sheds light on good or bad regions for multi-touch, and also the type
  of input most appropriate for each of these regions. Second, guided by the results
  from our study, we explore the design space of multi-touch-integrated desktop experiences.
  A set of new interaction techniques are coherently integrated into a desktop prototype,
  called Magic Desk, demonstrating potential uses for multi-touch enabled desktop
  configurations.
