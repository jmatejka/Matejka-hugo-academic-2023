abstract: We describe Chronicle, a new system that allows users to explore document
  workflow histories. Chronicle captures the entire video history of a graphical document,
  and provides links between the content and the relevant areas of the history. Users
  can indicate specific content of interest, and see the workflows, tools, and settings
  needed to reproduce the associated results, or to better understand how it was constructed
  to allow for informed modification. Thus, by storing the rich information regarding
  the document's history workflow, Chronicle makes any working document a potentially
  powerful learning tool. We outline some of the challenges surrounding the development
  of such a system, and then describe our implementation within an image editing application.
  A qualitative user study produced extremely encouraging results, as users unanimously
  found the system both useful and easy to use.
