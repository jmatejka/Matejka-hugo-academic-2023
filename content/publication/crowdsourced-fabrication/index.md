abstract: In recent years, extensive research in the HCI literature has explored interactive
  techniques for digital fabrication. However, little attention in this body of work
  has examined how to involve and guide human workers in fabricating larger-scale
  structures. We propose a novel model of crowdsourced fabrication, in which a large
  number of workers and volunteers are guided through the process of building a pre-designed
  structure. The process is facilitated by an intelligent construction space capable
  of guiding individual workers and coordinating the overall build process. More specifically,
  we explore the use of smartwatches, indoor location sensing, and instrumented construction
  materials to provide real-time guidance to workers, coordinated by a foreman engine
  that manages the overall build process. We report on a three day deployment of our
  system to construct a 12-tall bamboo pavilion with assistance from more than one
  hundred volunteer workers, and reflect on observations and feedback collected during
  the exhibit.
