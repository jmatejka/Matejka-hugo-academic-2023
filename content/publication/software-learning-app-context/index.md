abstract: Users of complex software applications frequently need to consult documentation,
  tutorials, and support resources to learn how to use the software and further their
  understand-ing of its capabilities. Existing online help systems provide limited
  context awareness through \"what's this?\" and simi-lar techniques. We examine the
  possibility of making more use of the user's current context in a particular application
  to provide useful help resources. We provide an analysis and taxonomy of various
  aspects of application context and how they may be used in retrieving software help
  artifacts with web browsers, present the design of a context-aware augmented web
  search system, and describe a prototype implementation and initial user study of
  this system. We conclude with a discussion of open issues and an agenda for further
  research.
