abstract: We describe TwitApp, an enhanced micro-blogging system integrated within
  AutoCAD for design sharing. TwitApp integrates rich content and still keeps the
  sharing transaction cost low. In TwitApp, tweets are organized by their project,
  and users can follow or unfollow each individual project. We introduce the concept
  of automatic tweet drafting and other novel features such as enhanced real-time
  search and integrated live video streaming. The TwitApp system leverages the existing
  Twitter micro-blogging system. We also contribute a study which provides insights
  on these concepts and associated designs, and demonstrates potential user excitement
  of such tools.
