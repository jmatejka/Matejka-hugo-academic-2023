abstract: We present Video Lens, a framework which allows users to visualize and interactively
  explore large collections of videos and associated metadata. The primary goal of
  the framework is to let users quickly find relevant sections within the videos and
  play them back in rapid succession. The individual UI elements are linked and highly
  interactive, supporting a faceted search paradigm and encouraging exploration of
  the data set. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific scenarios of Video Lens
  within the domain of professional baseball videos. A user study with 12 participants
  indicates that Video Lens efficiently supports a diverse range of powerful yet desirable
  video query tasks, while a series of interviews with professionals in the field
  demonstrates the framework's benefits and future potential.
