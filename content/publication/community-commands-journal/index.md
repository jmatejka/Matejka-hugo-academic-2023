abstract: We examine the use of modern recommender system technology to aid command
  awareness in complex software applications. We first describe our adaptation of
  traditional recommender system algorithms to meet the unique requirements presented
  by the domain of software commands. A user study showed that our item-based collaborative
  filtering algorithm generates 2.1 times as many good suggestions as existing techniques.
  Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its
  associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To
  evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD.
  This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application
  command recommendations in actual working environments. We report and visualize
  command usage behaviors during the study, and discuss how the recommendations affected
  users behaviors. In particular, we found that the plug-in successfully exposed users
  to new commands, as unique commands issued significantly increased.
