abstract: We explore the use of multi-finger input to emulate full mouse functionality,
  such as the tracking state, three buttons, and chording. We first present the design
  space for such techniques, which serves as a guide for the systematic investigation
  of possible solutions. We then perform a series of pilot studies to come up with
  recommendations for the various aspects of the design space. These pilot studies
  allow us to arrive at a recommended technique, the SDMouse. In a formal study, the
  SDMouse was shown to significantly improve performance in comparison to previously
  developed mouse emulation techniques.
