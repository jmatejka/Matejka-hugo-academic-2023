abstract: We present IP-QAT, a new community-based question and answer system for
  software users. Unlike most community forums, IP-QAT is integrated into the actual
  software application, allowing users to easily post questions, answers and tips
  without having to leave the application. Our in-product implementation is context-aware
  and shows relevant posts based on a user's recent activity. It is also designed
  with minimal transaction costs to encourage users to easily post, include annotated
  images and file attachments, as well as tag their posts with relevant UI components.
  We describe a robust cloud-based system implementation, which allowed us to release
  IP-QAT to 37 users for a 2 week field study. Our study showed that IP-QAT increased
  user contributions, and subjectively, users found our system more useful and easier
  to use, in comparison to the existing commercial discussion board.
