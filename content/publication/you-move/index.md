abstract: YouMove is a novel system that allows users to record and learn physical
  movement sequences. The recording system is designed to be simple, allowing anyone
  to create and share training content. The training system uses recorded data to
  train the user using a large-scale augmented reality mirror. The system trains the
  user through a series of stages that gradually reduce the user's reliance on guidance
  and feedback. This paper discusses the design and implementation of YouMove and
  its interactive mirror. We also present a user study in which YouMove was shown
  to improve learning and short-term retention by a factor of 2 compared to a traditional
  video demonstration.
