abstract: Typical commercial 3D CAD tools provide modal tools such as pan, zoom, orbit,
  look, etc. to facilitate freeform navigation in a 3D scene. Mastering these navigation
  tools requires a significant amount of learning and even experienced computer users
  can find learning confusing and error-prone. To address this we have developed a
  concept called \"Safe 3D Navigation\" where we augment these modal tools with properties
  to reduce the occurance of confusing situations and improve the learning experience.
  In this paper we describe the major properties needed for safe navigation, the features
  we implemented to realize these properties, and usability tests on the effectiveness
  of these features. We conclude that indeed these properties do improve the learning
  experience for users that are new to 3D. Furthermore, many of the features we implemented
  for safe navigation are also very popular with experienced 3D users. As a result,
  these features have been integrated into six commercial 3D CAD applications and
  we recommend other application developers include these features to improve 3D navigation.
