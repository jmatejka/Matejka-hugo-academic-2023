abstract: Expressive robots are useful in many contexts, from industrial to entertainment
  applications. However, designing expressive robot behaviors requires editing a large
  number of unintuitive control parameters. We present an interactive, data-driven
  system that allows editing of these complex parameters in a semantic space. Our
  system combines a physics-based simulation that captures the robot's motion capabilities,
  and a crowd-powered framework that extracts relationships between the robot's motion
  parameters and the desired semantic behavior. These relationships enable mixed-initiative
  exploration of possible robot motions. We specifically demonstrate our system in
  the context of designing emotionally expressive behaviors. A user-study finds the
  system to be useful for more quickly developing desirable robot behaviors, compared
  to manual parameter editing.
