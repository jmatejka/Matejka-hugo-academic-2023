abstract: 'The growth of mobile and wearable technologies has made it often difficult
  to understand what people in our surroundings are doing with their technology. In
  this paper, we introduce the concept of candid interaction: techniques for providing
  awareness about our mobile and wearable device usage to others in the vicinity.
  We motivate and ground this exploration through a survey on current attitudes toward
  device usage during interpersonal encounters. We then explore a design space for
  candid interaction through seven prototypes that leverage a wide range of technological
  enhancements, such as Augmented Reality, shape memory muscle wire, and wearable
  projection. Preliminary user feedback of our prototypes highlights the trade-offs
  between the benefits of sharing device activity and the need to protect user privacy.'
