abstract: 'Literally hundreds of thousands of users of 2D computer-aided design (CAD)
  tools are in the difficult process of transitioning to 3D CAD tools. A common problem
  for these users is disorientation in the abstract virtual 3D environments that occur
  while developing new 3D scenes. To help address this problem, we present a novel
  in-scene 3D widget called the ViewCube as a 3D orientation indicator and controller.
  The ViewCube is a cube-shaped widget placed in a corner of the window. When acting
  as an orientation indicator, the ViewCube turns to reflect the current view direction
  as the user re-orients the scene using other tools. When used as an orientation
  controller, the ViewCube can be dragged, or the faces, edges, or corners can be
  clicked on, to easily orient the scene to the corresponding view. We conducted a
  formal experiment to measure the performance of the ViewCube comparing: (1) ArcBall-style
  dragging using the ViewCube for manual view switching, (2) clicking on face/edge/corner
  elements of the ViewCube for automated view switching and (3) clicking on a dedicated
  row of buttons for automated view switching. The results indicate that users prefer
  and are almost twice as fast at using the ViewCube with dragging compared to clicking
  techniques, independent of a number of ViewCube representations that we examined.'
