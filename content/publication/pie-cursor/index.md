abstract: We describe a new type of graphical user interface widget called the \"PieCursor.\"
  The PieCursor is based on the Tracking Menu technique and consists of a radial cluster
  of command wedges, is roughly the size of a cursor, and replaces the traditional
  cursor. The PieCursor technique merges the normal cursor function of pointing with
  command selection into a single action. A controlled experiment was conducted to
  compare the performance of rapid command and target selection using the PieCursor
  against larger versions of Tracking Menus and a status quo Toolbar configuration.
  Results indicate that for small clusters of tools (4 and 8 command wedges) the PieCursor
  can outperform the toolbar by 20.8% for coarse pointing. For fine pointing, the
  performance of the PieCursor degrades approximately to the performance found for
  the Toolbar condition.
